# Shapeless structures do not have a defined shape and can be placed in any configuration.
# They are defined by the presence of specific blocks within a certain area.
# The structure is recognized if all required blocks are present within the defined area, regardless of their arrangement.


# Shaped structures have defined shapes, but can have some flexibility in block placement
