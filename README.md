## ‚úÖ Simple guide on installing the plugin.

Make sure the server software is **paper/purpur spigot 1.21+** and not spigot (for now)!

Install **Protocollib**, **Worldedit**, **Worldguard** and **Vault**.

When the server starts for the first time, it will automatically install the datapack and the server will restart automatically.

For sounds and gui effects, the plugin will automatically generate a resource pack in the server root, so take it and put it in the ResourcePack folder in your minecraft client.
